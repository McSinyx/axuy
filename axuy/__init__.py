"""Axuy is a minimalist peer-to-peer first-person shooter.

This package provides abstractions for writing custom front-ends and AIs.
All classes and helper functions are exposed at the package level.

Some superclasses may define abstract methods which must be overridden
in derived classes.  Subclasses only document newly introduced attributes.
